# Event-level Code of Diversity

_This is a working, living, in-progress document. Contributions are encouraged._

We believe that, as a precursor to making your event as diverse and inclusive as possible, you, the volunteers and the camp itself, should understand what that means.

Like a code of conduct for attendees, a code of diversity _\(name needs work\)_ for a camp is a public declaration of intent and setting of boundaries.

This complete statement should include:

* An acknowledgement of the systemic inequalities in the wider technology community.

* A demonstrated understanding that even with good intentions, unexamined biases can make events exclusionary and homogenous.

* A commitment to considering the implications on diversity and inclusion at every major event organization milestone.

* A commitment to making the event content, venue, post-mortem and social spaces as inclusive and diverse as possible.

\[ We should provide a sample statement here \]
