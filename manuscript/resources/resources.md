# Resources

This page is for collecting any links to educational materials that explain the importance of inclusion and how to make one's work or organization more diverse. Please add suggestions!

_NOTE: To get started, we will add as many links as possible to this list. Once it gets bigger, we will work on curating the list by editing links and organizing them topically._
