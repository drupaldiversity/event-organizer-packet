## Template for Concept Topic

> Converted from: https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide_guidelines/templates.html

 <!-- This template is for a topic that covers a concept.

 To use this template:
 - Copy it to your source directory with a new name, such as
   "blocks-overview.md". [The project coordinators may already have done
   that for you.]
 - Follow the instructions that are contained in lines starting with
   throughout this file.
 - Replace placeholder text with your content.
 - Before you submit your topic, remove all the lines in the file that
   start with  -- these are comments that do not belong in the topic. Also
   remove any blank lines that are before the ID line.
 - Then, if there are sections that do not apply to your topic (for example,
   Prerequisites might not), put  before the ==== on that line and leave
   those lines in the topic file. So it would look like:
   ## Prerequisite knowledge -->



 <!-- The first thing in the file is an ID: replace the text in the brackets below
 so that it matches the name of the file (without the .md extension; for
 example, {{ block-overview }} if the file name is block-overview.md. -->

# {{ id-goes-here }}
 <!-- The topic title goes on this line. Use "Title Case" for topic titles.
 Titles for Concept topics should start with "Concept: ", like this
 # Concept: .... -->


The next few lines are a summary of what the topic covers.

Explanation of what a foo is. No more than 140 characters.

 <!-- The next thing that is needed is an entry for the index:
 - Replace the text in (((indexentry))) with an appropriate index entry,
   such as (((Blocks,overview))). You can add additional index entries if
   appropriate.
 - Refer to the Guidelines if you have questions.
 - Also remove the  before the ((( so that this becomes an index entry
   and not a comment.

   (((indexentry)))

   Note - The index entry will be built as the eBook evolves using GitBook
   methods instead of ASCII-DOC.

   -->



## Prerequisite knowledge

 This section should mostly link to topic and concept tasks within
 the guide that someone would need to understand before trying this task.
 Some of the entries could be background knowledge that is needed that is
 not covered in the guide.

 Some ideas (remove the  to make these not comments):
* <<cross-reference-one>>
* <<cross-reference-two>>
* How to upload files from your local server to your web server.

Remove this placeholder text.


### What is a ...?

 Describe your concept here. The title of this section should be
 What is a ...? or What are ...? (where the ... is the same as the topic
 title). If the topic title contains several things to describe, you can also
 have multiple of these "What is a ..." sections.

 If possible, relate this concept to the specific scenario of the guide,
 perhaps using "for example" language.

Remove this placeholder text.


### Related topics

 In this section, make cross-references to related tasks and concepts that
 are covered in this book.
 Also remove the  so these lines are a list and not comments:
* <<cross-reference-1>>
* <<cross-reference-2>>

Remove this placeholder text.

### Additional resources

 In this section, make a list of outside references: videos, Drupal.org
 documentation, etc. Make sure all links have link text showing the name
 of the article or page it being linked to.


Remove this placeholder text.

 - When available, User's Drupal.org and/or GitHub.com User-Account should
